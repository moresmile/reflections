When would you want to create a remote repository rather then keeping all your work local?

	I would create remote repository in following cases: I would share my work with others developer, 
	for review, as portfolio presentation, or in case I am travelling, I'll know all working files are there


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	On this way I have full control and I can manage it on my own.
